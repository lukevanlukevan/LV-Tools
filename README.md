# LV Tools for Houdini

# PLEASE NOTE:

# LV Tools

A collection of HDAs that I use everyday to make my life easier/better/faster.

This is a pay-what-you-want project! If you would like to support me, you can do so at [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/lukevan) or [PayPal](https://paypal.me/wobblypictures?country.x=ZA&locale.x=en_US).

### Installation:

For those of you running Houdini 17.5 or later, you have an option for a much easier install.
Simply create a folder inside your Houdini preferences directory (where the houdini.env typically is) called "packages", and place the LVTools.json file from the download into that package folder. Your preferences directory on Windows is typically in `My Documents\houdiniXX.X`. In OS X it's in `~Library/Preferences/Houdini`.

Then edit LVTools.json and change the "LV" variable to match the LV Tools install path you chose in step 1 (the directory that contains "otls", "scripts", and so on).

# Please note

If you had this installed before, its worth redownloading and fixing the install directory as I made some changes to the structure of the git repo.
If you are a git user, its worth it to clear the folder and backup any preferences you need, and then reclone it.
